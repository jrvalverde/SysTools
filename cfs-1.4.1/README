7 DECEMBER 1997

This is version 1.4.0beta of CFS, the Cryptographic File System, which
also includes version 1.0 of ESM, the Encrypting Session Manager.

The CFS-USERS mailing list is now (finally) back in operation, but
the old subscriber list was wiped out.  You must subscribe again if you
did not subscribe after December 1997.

There is a mailing list, cfs-users, for discussion of topics of
interest to CFS and ESM users and developers.  To subscribe:
        echo subscribe | mail cfs-users-request@nsa.research.att.com
You will automatically receive a "welcome" message confirming that you
have been added to the list.

The latest version of CFS can be found at <http://www.cryptography.org> .
(Thanks to Michael Paul Johnson for hosting the site).

For installation instructions, see the files "README.install",
"notes.ms" and "README.esm".

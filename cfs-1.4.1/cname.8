.TH CNAME 8 ""
.SH NAME
cname
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cname
[ \-\fB3bms\fP ]
[ \-\fBv\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcname\fP prompts for a passphrase and reads, from standard input, a
list of CFS encrypted file names (e.g., "51051f97e31613b7").  It
produces, on standard output, a corresponding list of cleartext names.
By default, names are decrypted using standard 2-key hybrid mode
single-DES.  The \-\fB3\fP option specifies 2-key hybrid mode triple
DES.  \-\fBm\fP specifies 1-key hybrid MacGuffin. \-\fBs\fP specifies
SAFER-SK128.  The \-\fBv\fP option includes the ciphertext names in
the output.
.LP
All names must be specified one per input line, as individual path
components (full path names are not accepted).  If a name cannot be
decrypted to printable characters, "???" is printed in its place.
This is the only way to detect an incorrect passphrase.
.LP
\fBcname\fP is intended to assist in making sense of CFS directories
when no CFS daemon is available.  It is also useful in locating files
from backups.
.SH SEE ALSO
ccat(8)
.SH BUGS
Does not work with new format (1.3 and later) directories.
.LP
The program is easily confused by slightly wrong input.  It would be
better if it could transparently translate the output from other
programs such as ls(1), tar(1) and dump(8).

/*
 * Truerand is a dubious, unproven hack for generating "true" random
 * numbers in software.  It is at best a good "method of last resort"
 * for generating key material in environments where there is no (or
 * only an insufficient) source of better-understood randomness.  It
 * can also be used to augment unreliable randomness sources (such as
 * input from a human operator).
 *
 * The basic idea behind truerand is that between clock "skew" and
 * various hard-to-predict OS event arrivals, counting a tight loop
 * will yield a little bit (maybe one bit or so) of "good" randomness
 * per interval clock tick.  This seems to work well in practice even
 * on unloaded machines.  If there is a human operator at the machine,
 * you should augment trand with other measurements, such as keyboard
 * event timing.  On server machines (e.g., where you need to generate
 * a Diffie-Hellman secret but have no operator to type keys) trand
 * alone may (or may not) be sufficient.
 *
 * Because the randomness source is not well-understood, I've made
 * fairly conservative assumptions about how much randomness can be
 * extracted in any given interval.  Based on a cursory analysis of
 * the BSD kernel, there seem to be about 100-200 bits of unexposed
 * "state" that changes each time a system call occurs and that affect
 * the exact handling of interrupt scheduling, plus a great deal of
 * slower-changing but still hard-to-model state based on, e.g., the
 * process table, the VM state, etc.  There is no proof or guarantee
 * that some of this state couldn't be easily reconstructed, modeled
 * or influenced by an attacker, however, so we keep a large margin
 * for error.  The truerand API assumes only 0.3 bits of entropy per
 * interval interrupt, amortized over 24 intervals and whitened with
 * SHA.
 *
 * The trurand API is in randbyte.c, and consists of trand8(),
 * trand16(), and trand32().  Do not use raw_truerand() directly.
 * 
 * WARNING: depending on the particular platform, raw_truerand()
 * output may be biased or correlated.  In general, you can expect no
 * more than 8-16 bits of "pseudo-entropy" out of each 32 bit word.
 * Always run the output through a good post-whitening function (like
 * SHA, MD5 or DES or whatever) before using it to generate key
 * material.  The API does this for you, providing 8, 16, and 32 bit
 * properly "whitened" random numbers (trand8(), trand16(), and
 * trand32(), respectively).  Use the trand calls instead of calling
 * raw_truerand() directly.
 *
 * Test truerand on your own platform before fielding a system based
 * on this software or these techniques.
 *
 * This software seems to work well (at 10 or so bits per
 * raw_truerand() call) on a Sun Sparc-20 under SunOS 4.1.3 and on a
 * P100 under BSDI 2.0.  You're on your own elsewhere.
 *
 * This version of truerand doesn't clobber the ITIMER, so any
 * scheduled alarms will still occur (though alarms cannot occur while
 * raw_truerand is running and will be delayed by about 250ms per
 * raw_truerand call.

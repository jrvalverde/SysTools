@				DBConv
				======
			José R. Valverde (July, 2005)

A small utility to convert line-oriented text database files into 
character-separated values database files.

I wrote this utility to facilitate import of bioinformatics databases
(which are traditionally distributed as line-oriented flat files) into
tab-delimited format. More recently this kind for format has found
new life in various popular tools (like LDAP LDIF) and I retook the
code to extend it and suit it better to the UNIX phylosophy of
small, pluggable tools.

A straightforward extension to be introduced was to make it 
produce CSV files, and once at it, it was natural to make it more
generic. The result has been a new version of an ancient tool that
hopefully will find new life.

To learn more about DBConv, you can read the included man page.

INSTALLATION
------------

A Makefile for UNIX systems and an mkfile for VMS are included.
DBConv has been ported (in its former release) to other systems 
like MS-DOS and MacOS (even with nifty icons). It is a very
simpole tool, and in any case should have no problem compiling
as it should have no system dependencies.

For this release an effort has been made to adapt the old K&R
C code to more recent ANSI standards. Still, some glitch may
remain hidden.

To make DBConvert compile it using

	cc DBconv.c dbproc.c dbsetup.c -o dbconv

or use the provided Makefile (on UNIX systems) or mkfile
(for VMS).

Then copy the executable dbconv to a suitableplace in the users'
search path (usually /usr/local/bin) and the file dbconv.1 to 
the place for manual pages for applications (usually section 1, 
/usr/local/man/man1) and you are done.

SUPPORT
-------

The usual disclaimers apply (no guarantees, etc...). I will try my
best to support this program, but don't hold your breadth. You may
